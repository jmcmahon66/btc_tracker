## Compatibility

Works on Raspbian, with Raspberry Pi 7" touchcreen LED Display


## Installation

In 'Install/' directory:

```bash
./Install.sh
```
This will create a script to launch the application on Desktop,
write API key to file and install pip dependencies


## Usage

The installation will create a btc_tracker.sh script on Desktop, which can be double-clicked to launch.


## Configuration
Configuration files can be found in 'Configs/'

'config_pi.py' will be used for Raspberry Pi Platform, these values can be modified but may cause adverse effects

'api_key.py' in Configs/ will store the coinmarketcap API key for obtaining BTC price.

This can be pre-provided in the format:
```python
api_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
OR will be generated by the install script when the user enters an API key
